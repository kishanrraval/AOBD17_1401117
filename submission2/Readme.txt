The submission contains the following:
- A one page report describing the work we have done in comparing RPCA and PPCA-EM algorithms.
- The folder 'Implementation' contains -
	1. ppca_corrupted_image.m (Implementing ppca-em on a corrupted (noisy) image)
	2. ppca_missing_values.m (Implementing ppca-em on an image with missing data)
	3. RobustPCA.m (Function for RPCA)
	4. em_ppca.m (Function for PPCA-EM)
	5. rpca_corrupted_images.m (Implementing rpca on a corrupted (noisy) image)
	6. rpca_missing_values.m (Implementing rpca on an image with missing data)
- All codes use the image 'sample1.jpg' as input
- Graphs for comparison are also included here
