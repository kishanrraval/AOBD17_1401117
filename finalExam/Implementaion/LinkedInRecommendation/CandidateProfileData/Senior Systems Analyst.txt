We had to guarantee that several different acquirement processes entered automatically on their correct approvement workflows. Almost 60% of the company's payments are now able to be processed automatically. \n \nSkills Used \nMS Project, SAP-FI, SAP-MM. && Responsibilities \nMy main responsibility at this job was the delivery of a series of improvements to a custom logistics software to a Brazilian company called Petrobras Distribuidora.

Testing was done by the other team member and deployment was responsibility of another team. \n \nAccomplishments \nI believe this was the most relevant job I've ever done because it had a major result on the clients operations. The main improvement made had to be timing efficient as the client had a small window of time between the appearence of the necessity and the actual response he had to do into the system, and we managed to elaborate an efficient one-page-does-it-all pure Javascript interface that enabled him to achieve these goals within the desired time frame. \n \nSkills Used \nJava, Javascript, Websphere Portal, OpenStreetMap. We also had to interface with a pre-existing genetic programming service and I had to study it so we could uncover some of the bugs that needed fixing.

I also got to improve my discipline and organization. && Responsibilities \nMainly web development in ASP at a software factory building custom systems to Brazilian oil company Petrobras. \n \nAccomplishments \nAs my first job, I was able to learn a lot, specially doing maintenance on legacy systems that had poor (or zero) documentation.
