I\u2019ve now refined my trading to a point where I only need to place orders once a day at 6am leaving the rest of the day empty. I\u2019m now ready for my next challenge. && For the first year, every morning I walked around the local industrial estates cold calling, and then in the afternoons I would price all the enquiries up and quote the prospects. \nI developed a CRM which handled everything from automatically quoting customers, production control, invoicing and accounts. After a year I got so busy I had to take on staff and move into a factory. At one stage I had 8-10 staff members and 3 printing presses. The CRM I had developed really kicked in now, it was easy for the staff to learn and made us incredibly competitive going up against companies still using manual systems. \n \nWe had a demand for printing plain labels but struggled to find a reliable supplier, so I started up another company called Stick-It Labels. We became a respected supplier to other lithographic printers across the UK. \nI sold the company a year later for \u00a375,000 and ended up with a great supplier, so it worked out perfectly. \n \nThe sale of Stick-it Labels enabled me to purchase a larger factory. Before we moved in, I completely re-developed it putting in an extra floor and air conditioned offices. && I developed an application which I advertised via computer magazines. The programme had great reviews but it was pre-internet so expensive to market and distribute. && Some of the jobs included, sales, managing the art department, running the IT department and writing their CRM in MS Access. && I was employed to do the branch accounts, payments and banking. They saw my selling ability so my duties shifted more towards dealing with the customers on the shop floor. && My job was to sell \u00a3800 vacuum cleaners door to door. In my second month I had sold 18 Kirby\u2019s which placed me 7th out of more than 2,000 dealers in the UK. Within 4 months, I was promoted to an area distributor for Salisbury and subsequently employed six new dealers to work with me. However, being 19 years old with essentially a start-up business, I found it impossible to secure a lease for premises which stopped me in my tracks. && I joined my father\u2019s business after leaving school.

An accurate amount of inventory can make the business just as fast as incorrect inventory can ruin it. 'Allocating' this inventory accurately is a critical process as it ensures that the retailer has \"the right amount of the right products in the right places at the right time\". \n \nThe main challenges all retailers face while allocating products are identical, irrespective of whether they trade fashion items or groceries or whether they have a single store or five thousand stores. They fancy a well-organized, perfect method of translating their complicated merchandise plans into store level allocations. \n \nEffectively allocating products is a vital step in the product life cycle management as this is the last chance the retailer gets to send the right product to the right location. If this allocation of goods is done properly, it ensures that the correct amount of the products land up in the right places. On the other hand, if it is done poorly, it can lead to stock outs and lost sales for some items while other items incur high levels of inventory costs by sitting on the shelves of stores and warehouses resulting in consequent returns or clearances. \n \nRoles and Responsibilities: \n \nA Key member in the following activities: \n \n\u27a2 Handling Bundle Hot Fixes and Patch Releases \n\u27a2 Handling a 3 member team \n\u27a2 Analyzing the Scoped Bugs and preparing the Test Scenarios. \n\u27a2 Create System Test cases and executing them \n\u27a2 Bug reporting and tracking \n\u27a2 Create Regression Test cases and executing them \n\u27a2 Executing Integration Test cases \n\u27a2 Preparing Application Reference Manual \n\u27a2 Giving KT to new team members \n \nProject # 3: Integration Manager \n \nClient: Dun & Bradstreet \nDatabase Server: Oracle 9i \nTeam Size: 20 \nDuration: May'07 - Jun'08 \nRole: Test Lead \n \nDescription: D&B manages the world's most valuable commercial database with information on 83 million companies.
