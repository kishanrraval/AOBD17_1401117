{"CandidateID": "46", "Additional-Info": "None", "Skills": "C++ (5 years), C (3 years), Java Programming (3 years), c# (5 years), Scrum (4 years), SIP (5 years), VoIP (5 years), Unified Communications (5 years), Git (3 years), ClearCase (10+ years)", "Work-Experience": {"Company": "Datacom - Curitiba, PR && Siemens Enterprise Communications - Curitiba, PR && Siemens Enterprise Communications - M\u00fcnchen && Siemens Ltda - Curitiba, PR && Siemens - Curitiba, PR && Conectiva - Curitiba, PR", "Job-Description": "In Datacom I'm working together with MPLS team and joined several projects on it. My main responsibilities are the maintenances of MPLS protocol on Datacom network switches using C programming language for Linux embedded systems and development of test automation \nscripts using Python and/or unit tests in C. To achieve our goals we use agile methods, like Scrum, Kanban and standup meetings, and a Linux development environment with eclipse, vim, SeaScope, wireshark, gdb, git and BugZilla. Also, for the development of an entire FW version, I \nwas in the role of Code Integrator, were I was responsible for merging the fixes made by the team in a common branch, testing them and checking if the fixes didn't introduce another failure. If this happens, I should analyze and debug the code, assuring the quality of the changes made by the team. \nCurrently working on the project of a new firmware, based on an Operational System architecture, where modules are developed by different teams and grouped later. This is being done in C++. In this project, I'm in the role of developer and also Scrum Master, helping the team to achieve its goals. && I\u2019ve participated on the project OpenScape Desktop Client (ODC), a softphone from Siemens, where I\u2019ve started doing modifications on graphical interface and later I was the only responsible and maintainer of the communication core of the program, containing three modules, named SIP Engine, MSIWrapper and SoftOLA. The first two modules were responsible for establishing a phone call using SIP protocol and streaming media to the other participant (audio using RTP, RTPS and video using H.263 or H.264). The latest module makes the communication with Siemens PABX, using H.323 protocol. I was also responsible for maintaining the interface between these modules and the ODC user interface.  \nTo perform this work, I used VisualStudio 2005 and 2010, C#, Managed C++, standard C++, C and boost library. To debug and understand problems, I used a lot wireshark to check the message flow, log files generated by the program and core-dump to check stack traces. && On this period of time, I was the interface between Husim users in Munich and development team in Curitiba. My main task was to help the users to identify the problems, checking if it was from a wrong test script, from Husim, from PABX or from the phones. Another task was to help \nusers to develop or improve test scripts, analyzing their scenario and proposing the best solution for them. && I worked with Husim team in Curitiba, hired by a third-party company from April 2003 until March 2006, and from this date on as a Siemens employee. The projects I worked on were: \n\u2022 Husim tools \u2013 These tools were developed in C and was responsible for compiling a script written in Husim language to simulate phone endpoints, sending the script to Husim Server, collecting the results, translating the result from byte codes to human readable text (phone display information by example) and comparing it to a good case checking if some error happened. \n\u2022 Husim 5.0 \u2013 It was the core of Husim, this project was the evolution of Husim 4, and consisted of a board named HIGate plugged as a main controller of a PABX shelf, interfacing with other peripherals boards on the same shelf and the Husim server located in a Linux PC. The Husim server was developed in C and its graphical interface in GTK. It acts as the brain of Husim, receiving the scripts and controlling the execution by sending the commands to be executed on HIGate. \n\u2022 Integrated Test Controller (iTeC) \u2013 developed in java as a server \u2013 client program, using CORBA to communicate between them and MySQL as database, it was a graphical interface designed to control a scenario test execution, by calling the husim tools to each test on the scenario. \n\u2022 Husim Eclipse Plugin \u2013 a plugin made to run Husim scripts directly from eclipse IDE \n\u2022 Integrated Test Manager (iTeM) \u2013 The evolution of iTeC. This program was made on java and used MySQL to store all relevant information about the tests. This program was a complete quality assurance manager.It was possible to insert requirements for a project, create a test plan, a test execution, versions of it, which feature should be tested in a specific version, generate reports and, of course, execute manual or automatic Husim tests, as iTeC did. \n\u2022 Husim 5.5 \u2013 Evolution of Husim 5.0. The GUI was redesigned in java and detached from the server. Starting at this version the GUI would run in any computer and connect to a remote Husim Server.  \n\u2022 Husim API \u2013 An API made in java, to create scripts using java or any script language that uses java. The officially supported script language was groovy. Also the Husim tools were ported to java, so the execution was made directly from iTeM or Eclipse. \n\u2022 SimClient HFA and SimClient SIP \u2013 Two applications designed to simulate softphones, using h323 protocol or SIP protocol. Both of them were developed using Visual Studio, C++ and MFC. && Trainee in R&D, developing solutions of Automation Tools for Siemens PBX for Linux and Windows, using programming languages C and GTK. && As a trainee, I did telephonic support for users of Conectiva Linux, new distro testing, bug reporting and Linux administration and configuration;", "Job-Duration": "November 2013 to August 2016 && March 2009 to November 2013 && September 2007 to February 2009 && April 2003 to September 2007 && August 2001 to March 2003 && June 2001 to August 2001", "Job Title": "Embedded Software Designer && Development Engineer && Husim User Support && Development Engineer && Trainee && Trainee"}, "Location": "Curitiba, PR", "Education": {"Institute": "Pontif\u00edcia Universidade Cat\u00f3lica do Paran\u00e1 && Universidade Federal do Paran\u00e1 Curitiba, PR", "School-Duration": "2011 to 2012 && 1996 to 2003", "Qualification": "Software Engineering Specialization && None"}, "Resume-Summary": "None"}]
